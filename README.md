REST API endpoints for pull requests

About pull requests
You can list, view, edit, create, and merge pull requests using the REST API. For information about how to interact with comments on a pull request, see REST API endpoints for issue comments.

Pull requests are a type of issue. Any actions that are available in both pull requests and issues, like managing assignees, labels, and milestones, are handled by the REST API to manage issues. To perform these actions on pull requests, you must use the issues API endpoints (for example, ), not the pull requests endpoints. For more information, see REST API endpoints for issues./repos/{owner}/{repo}/issues/{issue_number}
